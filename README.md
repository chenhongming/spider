Keywords to achieve crawl Baidu, Google, Bing pictures


  1. If you want to use the keyword to crawl Baidu's picture, please run spider_baidu.py.

  2. Similarly, you can also run spider_bing.py, spider_google_quick.py, spider_google_slow.py to crawl images from different search engines.

  3. Here, I offer two ways to crawl Google's pictures. One is crawling faster, but it may be interrupted during the crawl(very low probability)for Google's anti-climb mechanism.So I provide a slower version.

  4. In short, you can combine both to achieve better results.
